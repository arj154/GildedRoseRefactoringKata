# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata #

This is the Gilded Rose Kata the rules of which can be found [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt)

I attempted this within the constraints of the Kata which led to the Items class being subclassed rather than inheriting from a subclass, this may be improved in the future with a different branch. I may return to this utilising more Java 8 features as well.
